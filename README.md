# Beatsaber quest (il2cpp) modloader/function hooking poc

This just loads mods (`.so` files) from `/sdcard/Android/data/com.beatgames.beatsaber/files/mods/` and includes some examples for function hooking.

Uses https://github.com/ele7enxxh/Android-Inline-Hook + some macros for magic

Follow https://koz.io/using-frida-on-android-without-root/ to learn how to inject the modloader-library into the beatsaber apk (with the so built from this instead of frida)

The function offsets (as well as infos about the structs) can be obtained with il2cppdumper
